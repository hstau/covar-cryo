In chimera, to

1. get the coordinates of a point in the marker set: getcrd sel
2. set background color: set bg_color white
3. get the transf matrix and applied to other segments: first fit map of
40S segment to vol_all.spi, then transform DHX segment via a. matrixget
filename, now edit filename and copy-paste the transf matrix for other segments and
finally b. matrixset filename


Results of various testing:

finesp

1.if use l1 minimization, map appears blob like (there is a fine line when tunning the parameter)
2.if filtered to 0.3 prior to cov estimation, the map is not cut anymore.
3.normalizing reproj individually seems to produce (an extra?) density inside the 40S
